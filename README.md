# site
This repository contains the source for my personal website.

The site is built using [MkDocs](http://mkdocs.org) and the [Material theme](http://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
I use Travis CI to automagicaly rebuild the site and push to https://github.com/KurtJacobson/kurtjacobson.github.io when 
ever I push changes to this repo. For deployment I use the very handy `deploy.sh` script found here https://github.com/X1011/git-directory-deploy
