[![Build Status][badge]](https://travis-ci.org/KurtJacobson/site)

# site

This repository contains the source for my website: http://www.kcjengr.com

The site is built using [MkDocs][mkdocs] and the [Material theme][theme].
I use Travis CI to build the site and the `deploy.sh` script found [here][script]
to push the site to https://github.com/KurtJacobson/kcjengr.com, from
which it is hosted by GitHub.
