# site
This repository contains the source for my website: http://www.kcjengr.com

The site is built using [MkDocs](http://mkdocs.org) and the very attractive 
[Material theme](http://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
I use Travis CI to build the site and the `deploy.sh` script found here 
https://github.com/X1011/git-directory-deploy to push the changes to 
https://github.com/KurtJacobson/kurtjacobson.github.io, from which it is hosted
by GitHub.
