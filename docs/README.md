# www.kcjengr.com

This repo hosts my website, www.kcjengr.com, which is generated from the source
files located here: https://github.com/KurtJacobson/site

The site is built using [MkDocs][mkdocs] and the [Material theme][theme].
I use Travis CI to build the site and the `deploy.sh` script found [here][script]
to deploy the site to this repo, from which it is published.
